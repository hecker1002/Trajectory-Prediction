### Trajectory Prediction in Real Time of Autonomous Vechicles in   Real Time

Hi , this Project was built as a part of building something cool and exciting on my own . THis approach was my own idea of using a CNN  ( MobileNet V2 a lite tf  pre-trained model ) to extract the features form an image in real time and using them in a stacked LSTM architecture to predict the future 10 steps of the captured vehicles or pedectrian . 
Initially , I trained the Complete contraption over the segmented images from the continuous vdeo frames and then re-tintegrated it over the indivual frames over the whole video .

## Future Prospects - 

THis project is still in a developing phase requiring a lot  of hyperparameter tuning and re-training which I am planning to do over the course of few weeks . In time , if you have any nerw ideas to integrate in this projey , I would be really happy to hear them 


# Final Results  - 

Herewith I am dropping a small clip of the final output ( the Circle is the sterring wheel of my Car , I know it looks bad :(  .
